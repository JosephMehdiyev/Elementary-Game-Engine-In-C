Cormat is a 3D/2D engine for visualizing mathematical graphs and for physics simulations. Currently, it is in the development and barely anything is done.
# ROADMAP
The project is under development, here are the things I am planning to do in order.
1. Add proper gridlines for floor.
2. Properly develop 3D, and 2D modes.
2. Make a shortcut to change between 3D and 2D.
3. Properly developp graph mode and simulation mode
3. Make a shortcut to change between the graph mode and simulation mode.
4. Visual improvements, new visual modes and anti-aliasing.

# Dependecies
* [OpenGL](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Getting_Started#Downloading_OpenGL)  API for rendering 2D-3D graphics
* [GLFW](https://github.com/glfw/glfw) API for creating windows, reading input and handling events
* [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h) for textures
* [CGLM](https://github.com/recp/cglm) for linear algebra 
* [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/) to compile the project

# Build

To build and run, run these commands.

```
git clone https://github.com/JosephMehdiyev/cormat
cd /to/your/folder/path
cd  build
make alle
make run
```
I only compiled this in Linux ARCH. I did not test this program on other distros.
