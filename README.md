This project ( was supposed to be) a 3D/2D engine for visualizing mathematical graphs and for physics simulations. Currently, it is abandoned in favor of C++ version.
# Important Note
The project is abandoned in favor of C++ version of the project. I have realized how pointless it is to write this in C without classes and OOP. 
I will abandon this repository and open a new repository fully written in C++.

# Dependecies
* [OpenGL](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Getting_Started#Downloading_OpenGL)  API for rendering 2D-3D graphics
* [GLFW](https://github.com/glfw/glfw) API for creating windows, reading input and handling events
* [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h) for textures
* [CGLM](https://github.com/recp/cglm) for linear algebra 
* [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/) to compile the project

# Shortcuts
* Use keys W,A,S,D to walk around
* Use mouse to look around
* Use mouse scrool to zoom in and out
* Use UP arrow and DOWN arrow to go up and down respectively
# Build

To build and run, run these commands.

```
git clone https://github.com/JosephMehdiyev/cormat
cd /to/your/folder/path
cd  build
make all
make run
```
I only compiled this in Linux ARCH. I did not test this program on other distros.
